#Factories

Factories are single chests which require a large number of items to construct, but once built, provide highly efficient production recipes. However, they wear down both during use and over time, so they require regular maintenance to keep running. The main motivation for Factories are:

-  A form of [**Capital Goods**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_good) where communal investment in a factory can benefit an entire community.
-  **Permanence of capital** in factories since they cannot be moved. This creates a substantial cost for people to move away from each other, forcing cooperation (or subjugation) between neighbours.
-  A **custom tech tree** which can be dynamically modified, making it so that high level technologies can be made extremely hard to get.

#Tutorial

1.  Insert the exact amount of materials required for the factory into a chest.
1.  Left click the chest while holding the stick. You will receive a confirmation message that you have created a factory.
1.  To use the factory left click the chest using a stick, this will bring up a menu in the chat window detailing the different recipes available. Mousing over the recipes will show what they require and what they make.
1.  Place the required items into the chest.
1.  Click on recipe in the chat window wish you wish to use, the factory will then convert your raw materials into a produced good!

#Details about Factories

##Factory Breakdown and repair

Factories break down both through regular use and through decay over time. Each time a recipe is used the factory is worn down a little bit, on average about 10% of its total health. Factories will also rust rapidly in the minecraft environment where they lose 100% of their health over a 28 day period (based on the minecraft tick). Once a factory reaches 0% health either through use or decay, it is destroyed forever. To prevent this you need to regularly repair your factory through its repair recipe. To repair a factory to 100% health you need to pay 10% of its initial cost. Keeping factories around is expensive and not for the faint of heart!

##Factory Destruction

Breaking the chest that makes up the factory is not good for it! It won't immediately destroy the factory, but it will lower its health to 25% percent if its not below that already. This means if you don't replace the chest and repair the factory in the next 7 days it will get down to 0% health and be gone forever!

##Factory Permissions

Use of a factory is restricted to individuals who can open and close the chest that makes up the Factory. In order to take control of someone else's factory you need to break down their citadel reinforcement and replace them with your own.
